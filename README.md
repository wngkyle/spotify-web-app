### Description

- Users can access the web app by logging in with their Spotify accounts. Once logged in, they can explore the Spotify music library by inputting either an artist's name or a song title into the search bar located at the top of the page. The search results are presented in a list just below the search bar for easy browsing. Selecting a song from this list transitions the interface into player mode, granting users the ability to play, pause, and fine-tune the volume to their personal preference. To curate their musical journey, the app offers the option to add songs to their "Liked Songs" playlist, which can be done by pressing the like button at the bottom left of the page. Furthermore, lyrics are integrated into the play mode, providing a more immersive and engaging music streaming experience.
